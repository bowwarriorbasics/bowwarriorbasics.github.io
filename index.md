# Introducing: ThinkUH

### "a guide to the University of Hawai'i at Manoa community"

## The Problem

As a student on campus, wouldn't you like to know about the good and bad of each course? How about knowing what parts *really* gave people trouble? Or how about hearing voices from other students commenting on each course? Or how about hearing about the different clubs and events going on at campus?

## The Solution

[**ThinkUH**](https://thinkuh.meteorapp.com/) is a crowd-sourced information source for your academic courses and your community. Join and learn from fellow students about what your future is really like, and what is presently going on!

## Tentative Features

- Login/account system for personalized accounts
