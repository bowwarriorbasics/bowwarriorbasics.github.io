# Introducing: Bow Warrior Basics

### "a guide to the University of Hawai'i at Manoa community"

## The Problem

As a student on campus, how do you learn the “basics” about a degree program?  
About the food services? About parking and commuting? About staying safe after 
dark? About the host culture?

## The Solution

**Bow Warrior Basics** is a crowd-sourced, dynamic “README” guide for 
introducing UH students to any and all topics relevent to the community for 
which introductory knowledge is difficult to come by. Students can both propose 
topic areas and provide content for those topic areas. Content can be voted up, 
down, or banned by administrators if innappropriate.
